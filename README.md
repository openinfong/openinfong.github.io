## 📌 Why This Matters

Too often, access to critical civic information in Nigeria is fragmented or hidden. Open Info NG was created to **bridge the information gap**, help citizens know their rights, and shift the mindset that governance is distant or inaccessible. Public servants are meant to serve the people — and Open Info NG helps make that service visible.
